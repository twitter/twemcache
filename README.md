[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/twitter/twemcache.png)](http://travis-ci.org/twitter/twemcache)

Twemcache is no longer actively maintained.  See [twitter/pelikan](https://github.com/twitter/pelikan) for our latest caching work.

Twemcache (pronounced "tw-em-cache") is the Twitter Memcached. Twemcache is based on a fork of [Memcached](http://memcached.org/) v.1.4.4 that has been heavily modified to make to suitable for the large scale production environment at Twitter.

## Build

To build twemcache from distribution tarball:

    $ ./configure
    $ make
    $ sudo make install

To build twemcache from distribution tarball with a non-standard path to [libevent](http://libevent.org) install:

    $ ./configure --with-libevent=<path>
    $ make
    $ sudo make install

To build twemcache from distribution tarball with a statically linked libevent:

    $ ./configure --enable-static=libevent
    $ make
    $ sudo make install

To build twemcache from distribution tarball in _debug mode_ with _assertion panics enabled_:

    $ CFLAGS="-ggdb3 -O0" ./configure --enable-debug=full
    $ make
    $ sudo make install

To build twemcache from source with _debug logs enabled_ and _assertions disabled_:

    $ git clone git@github.com:twitter/twemcache.git
    $ cd twemcache
    $ autoreconf -fvi
    $ ./configure --enable-debug=log
    $ make V=1
    $ src/twemcache -h

## Features

* Supports the complete memcached ASCII protocol.
* Supports tcp, udp and unix domain sockets.
* Observability through lock-less stats collection and klogger.
* Pluggable eviction strategies.
* Easy debuggability through assertions and logging.

## Slabs and Items

Memory in twemcache is organized into fixed sized slabs whose size is configured using the -I or --slab-size=N command-line argument. Every slab is carved into a collection of contiguous, equal size items. All slabs that are carved into items of a given size belong to a given slabclass. The number of slabclasses and the size of items they serve can be configured either from a geometric sequence with the initial item size set using -n or --min-item-chunk-size=N argument and growth ratio set using -f or --factor=D argument, or from a profile string set using -z or --slab-profile=S argument.

## Eviction

Eviction is triggered when a cache reaches full memory capacity. This happens when all cached items are unexpired and there is no space available to store newer items. Twemcache supports the following eviction strategies, configured using the -M or --eviction-strategy=N command-line argument:

* No eviction (0) - don't evict, respond with server error reply.
* Item LRU eviction (1) - evict only existing items in the same slab class, least recently updated first; essentially a per-slabclass LRU eviction.
* Random eviction (2) - evict all items from a randomly chosen slab.
* Slab LRA eviction (4) - choose the least recently accessed slab, and evict all items from it to reuse the slab.
* Slab LRC eviction (8) - choose the least recently created slab, and evict all items from it to reuse the slab. Eviction ignores freeq & lruq to make sure the eviction follows the timestamp closely. Recommended if cache is updated on the write path.

Eviction strategies can be *stacked*, in the order of higher to lower bit. For example, `-M 5` means that if slab LRA eviciton fails, Twemcache will try item LRU eviction.

## Observability

### Stats

Stats are the primary form of observability in twemcache. Stats collection in twemcache is lock-less in a sense that each worker thread only updates its thread-local metrics, and a background aggregator thread collects metrics from all threads periodically, holding only one thread-local lock at a time. Once aggregated, stats polling comes for free. There is a slight trade-off between how up-to-date stats are and how much burden stats collection puts on the system, which can be controlled by the aggregation interval -A or --stats-aggr-interval=N command-line argument. By default, the aggregation interval is set to 100 msec. You can set the aggregation interval at run time using `config aggregate <num>\r\n` command. Stats collection can be disabled at run time by passing a negative aggregation interval or at build time through the --disable-stats configure option.

Metrics exposed by twemcache are of three types - timestamp, counter and gauge and are collected both at the global level and per slab level. You can read about the description of all stats exposed by twemcache using the -D or --describe-stats command-line argument.

The following commands can be used to query stats from a running twemcache
* `stats\r\n`
* `stats settings\r\n`
* `stats slabs\r\n`
* `stats sizes\r\n`
* `stats cachedump <id> <limit>\r\n`

### Klogger (Command Logger)

Command logger allows users to capture the details of every incoming request. Each line of the command log gives precise information on the client, the time when a request was received, the command header including the command, key, flags and data length, a return code, and reply message length. Few example klog lines look as follows:

    172.25.135.205:55438 - [09/Jul/2012:18:15:45 -0700] "set foo 0 0 3" 1 6
    172.25.135.205:55438 - [09/Jul/2012:18:15:46 -0700] "get foo" 0 14
    172.25.135.205:55438 - [09/Jul/2012:18:15:57 -0700] "incr num 1" 3 9
    172.25.135.205:55438 - [09/Jul/2012:18:16:05 -0700] "set num 0 0 1" 1 6
    172.25.135.205:55438 - [09/Jul/2012:18:16:09 -0700] "incr num 1" 0 1
    172.25.135.205:55438 - [09/Jul/2012:18:16:13 -0700] "get num" 0 12

The command logger supports lockless read/write into ring buffers, whose size can be configured with -x or --klog-entry=N command-line argument. Each worker thread logs to a thread-local buffer as they process incoming queries, and a background thread asynchronously dumps buffer contents to a file configured with -X or --klog-file=S command-line argument.

Since this feature has the capability of generating hundreds of MBs of data per minute, the use must be planned carefully. An enabled klog moduled can be started or stopped by sending `config klog run start\r\n` and `config klog run stop\r\n` respectively. To control the speed of log generation, the command logger also supports sampling. Sample rate can be set over with `config klog sampling <num>\r\n` command, which samples one of num commands.

### Logging

Logging in twemcache is only available when it is built with logging enabled (--enable-debug=[full|yes|log]). By default logs are written to stderr. Twemcache can also be configured to write logs to a specific file through the -o or --output=S command-line argument.

On a running twemcache, we can turn log levels up and down by sending it SIGTTIN and SIGTTOU signals respectively and reopen log files by sending it SIGHUP signal. Logging levels can be set to a specific value using the `verbosity <num>\r\n` command.
